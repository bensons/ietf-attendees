ietf-attendees
==============
This is a collection of Perl scripts that I've hacked together to count the number of
IETF meeting attendees from various companies. Feel free to gather whatever meaning
you want from these figures... Or none, if that makes more sense. :)

These scripts require the HTML::TableExtract module to be installed.

Input data for each IETF meeting comes from that meeting's list of registered attendees
such as https://www.ietf.org/registration/ietf89/attendance.py

To count attendees from each company at a given IETF meeting, run something like:
./ietf-company.pl ietf89.html

To count attendees across all IETF meetings (from ietf74 onward) run something like:
./ietf-co-hist.pl 89
where the argument ("89" in the example above) is the latest attendee data file that's
availble in the local directory. The output is CSV-formatted text.

There are a few company-specific tools that need to be updated to be more generic.
But if you want to try them, an example is:
./brocade-employees.pl ietf89.html

The unknown-employees.pl script doesn't work at this time. It doesn't do what the
other *-employees.pl scripts do... I'm trying to make it guess employer affiliations
based on authorstats etc. But it's fairly broken.
