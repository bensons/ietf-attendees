Stuff To Do to make these scripts Better
- Pull the company details (currently hardcoded) into a separate file, to be included like a config file
- change the various *-employee.pl scripts to take a company name argument, rather than having a bunch
  of company specific scripts
- write script to auto-download / update the data files
